# Uninformed Search Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various uninformed search algorithms in Python. Uninformed search algorithms, also known as blind search algorithms, explore the search space without any domain-specific knowledge beyond the problem definition.


## Features

- Clear and easy-to-understand implementations of each algorithm.
- Example usage for each algorithm demonstrating how to search for a goal in a tree structure.
- Customizable node and tree structures to fit different use cases.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. This code is compatible with Python 3.12.
